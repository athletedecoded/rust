/*
* `Option` is an enum which encodes the concept of a value being present or absent
* To enforce compiler safety, Rust does not have an explicit `Null` value type
* Ensures we don't assume not-null valuen case, when it could be present
* Must convert an Option<T> to a T before performing operations 
    --> Prevents the assumption something isnâ€™t null when it actually is.
* `match` control flow allows us to define what happens when there is Some(T) and None
* compiler confirms that both cases are handled
